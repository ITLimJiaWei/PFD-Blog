                    The Hackathon organized by Overflow SIG allowed us to accomplish our planned features albeit with alot of hard work. Xavier, Jun Hong
                    and the rest of the team surprised me with their continuous effort through the long hours from morning to late evening. Amos was working 
                    on finalizing the inception deck and presentation slides while the rest of us worked on the software development. Jun Hong was testing
                    our oneToken feature and I was improving our frontend by adding a timeline to indicate which stage of the application the user was 
                    currently at

                    On the final day of our Hackathon, the day before the presentation with OCBC, we were all focused on bug testing and were quite 
                    stressed. Our presentation slides were yet to be finalized and we stayed up to around 2pm to properly rehearse our pitch. In the end,
                    we decided on a recorded demo for the main portion of our presentation and a live demo for oneToken. I believe the recorded demo 
                    allowed us to avoid any unknown bugs/errors we did not manage to troubleshoot while the oneToken live demo showed off the uniqueness 
                    of the feature.

                    If I am to be completely honest with myself, I believe oneJoint could have been better both in UI/UX and features. Although we managed
                    to put out a decent product at the end of 5 weeks, the front-end design could have been more appealing and we should have had focused more
                    on troubleshooting bugs/errors. However, I was quite satisfied with our presentation with OCBC but did regret editing out parts of the recorded demo 
                    such as the filling in information portions as the OCBC judges seem to consider those elements in their criteria.
