                    Today we had our first F2F meeting with Mr Joel. He gave constructive criticism on improving our UI/UX, discussed
                    our planned features for oneJoint and gave advice on how to prepare for the presentation with OCBC next friday.
                    By this time, we had finalized our wireframes, databases and features and all of us were in developing the planned 
                    features.
                    <br>
                    Our first F2F meeting was highly productive as we could iron out issues much faster than on Telegram/Teams and discussion was also
                    alot simpler. By this time, Singpass was functional as well as login and joint account form views. Without integrating our authentication,
                    a joint account record was able to be created in the database.
