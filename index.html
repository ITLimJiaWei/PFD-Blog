          <p class="index-paragraph">
            When I first looked at the challenge statement, <b>"Safe and Seamless Joint Account Creation"</b>, I was rather <b>intimidated</b> as I had only worked on 
            account creations for a single person and never two. On top of this, it being safe and seamless was important as the prototype was being designed
            for <b>OCBC Bank</b>. This means that in theory, security is essential as we would be dealing with OCBC's customers' funds and personal details such as NRIC and more.
            These requirements made me nervous yet excited to test my skills at something I have never done.
            <br>
            In the first lesson of PFD, our lecturer, <b>Mr Joel Yang</b>, instructed us to fill in our strengths and weakness in terms of technical aspects
            such as <b>programming knowledge</b>, <b>UI/UX design</b> and more. Later on, we were told to use padlet and fill in our ideas for a prototype which solves
            the provide challenge statement and then vote for other suggestions. To my surprise, I was chosen as a <b>Group Leader</b> after receiving the 4th most votes
            as seen in the image on the left. Following this, I had to select my group members anonymously according to their strengths and weaknesses. I tried my best to
            pick members of different strengths that cover each other's weaknesses as well as my own. 
            Week 1's lesson made me feel rather <b>uneasy</b> as I have never worked with my group members before and was worried that I would not be able to lead
            a team effectively.

            Since the chosen challenge statement only involved IT students, I was sure that majority of the team had the necessary technical skills to develop
            a working prototype for Joint Account Creation. This was due to us undergoing a module called "Web Application Development" in Semester 2.1 which allowed
            us to develop our full-stack development skills which we had gathered from prior modules such as "Databases" and "Interactive Development". Out of the 5 of us 
            in the team, only 2 members were experienced in Mobile App Development. As a result, we decided on developing a web application using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework
            and an SQL database. Being the team leader, I set up a Trello Board for us to collaborate and quickly assigned a tasks for each member to complete by an agreed deadline.
            I also began to work on oneJoint's wireframe at this time on Adobe XD. Since the rest of the team were not adept in UI/UX Design, I took charge of most if not 
            all of the Front End Development.

            Once I had settled in with my new group members, Week 2's Lesson had begun. Mr Joel Yang went on to brief us on group/conflict management 
            and that there were many different conflict management styles. As seen from Figure 2.1 (Above), there were 5 styles consisting of a <b>shark,
            turtle, fox, teddy-bear and owl</b> which all have their own characteristics. After completing some questions, my team and I were able to determine 
            which animal we were able to relate to the most. I was quite well rounded excluding the turtle with <b>Collaborating</b> and <b>Accommodating</b> being my 
            highest triats at 9 which means I am most like a <b>teddy-bear</b> and an <b>owl</b>. The rest of my team also had similar traits as seen in 
            Figure 2.2 (Above) which made me believe we would be able to work together well to deliver a good prototype for OCBC bank.

            <br>
            My team and I were currently in the storming/norming stages of team development where some are afraid to show their opinion and there could be some <b>clashes</b>
            in opinion on how to proceed. Thankfully, we were respectful towards one another and managed to agree on certain issues early on so they do not persist and 
            drag down our productivity later on.

            As discussed in Week 1, I was in charge of the overall <b>UI/UX</b> of oneJoint and I had created a wireframe as seen in Figure 2.3 (Left). <b>Jun Hong</b>,
            one of my team members also has created a data dictionary while <b>Xavier</b> had been hard at work creating a SQL data script based off the data dictionary.
            The other 2 members, <b>Darius</b> and <b>Tze Siong</b> were researching on how Joint Accounts were created in existing systems and what information is required so as to
            improve the data dictionary.
            At this point in Assignment 1, I had created a base ASP.NET MVC Core project using Visual Studio Community 2019 along with portions of the landing page 
            being completed. We were past the <b>storming</b> stage and were able to convery our ideas and opinions effectively.

          <div class="index-paragraph" style="padding-bottom:25px;">
            In Week 3, the team and I have completed oneJoint's landing page as seen in Figure 3.1 (Right) and have tested a few 2 factor authentication(2FA)
            methods to ensure the security of our Joint Account system. These include <b>oneToken</b>, our mobile app authentication method and <b>oneLink</b>, our email 
            authentication method as seen in Figure 3.2 (Below). Jun Hong was in charge of oneToken and created the mobile app for it as well as relevant Firebase libraries and code. Xavier
            had completed the database script and was modifying it as we discovered more business requirements and bugs with our orignal code. Meanwhile, Tze
            Siong and Darius worked on polishing our <b>Inception Deck</b> and completing <b>Data Access Layers(DALs)</b> of oneJoint.

            <br>
            Other than Front End Development, I was also responsible for the <b>main flow</b> of the Joint Account application. At first, it was difficult to determine
            which authentication system to use for what kind of user(E.g. Singaporean/PR, Foreigner etc). However, as I discused with the rest of the team, we had simplified
            the process to those who were not existing customers to use oneLink and those who were existing customer utilize oneToken due to their existing OCBC accounts which are 
            required to login into our mobile app. Our meetings with our OCBC instructor, Yan Jie were also quite <b>constructive</b> as he had many meaningful insights into 
            what is expected of us and how we should go about achieving it. For example in Week 3, he commented that we had focused too much on business requirements when 
            OCBC Bank was not expecting us to produce a highly accurate Joint Account system.

            At this stage of Assignment 1, my team 1 and I were close to the <b>"Performing"</b> stage of team development. This was accommodated by a <b>F2F</b> session with 
            Mr Joel Yang on Wednesday(10/11/2021) which was much more <b>productive</b> compared to the Teams meetings we had been having up to this point. We were able to 
            communicate our opinions more effectively and were more focused as the deadline of Assignment 1 drew closer. Furthermore, Mr Joel Yang provided critical feedback/criticism 
            on our current progress and state of affairs. He also gave us some recommendations on how to improve/market oneJoint for the presentation with OCBC Bank in Week 5. For example, Mr Joel recommended that we add 
            a timeline of sorts to display to the user which step of the application he/she was at. As a result, I implemented a simplistic timeline as seen in Figure 4.1 (Left).

            <br>

            oneJoint had its main and joint applicant forms completely in terms of the Front End but the Back End which includes C# and SQL database still had some teething
            issues to be fixed. For example, there were many foreign key constraint issues with SQL database as seen in Figure 4.2 (Above) when we first completed the code for the back end
            of the applicant forms. However, due to MVC and its separation of concerns, we were able to diagnose the problems quickly and assessed that the problem 
            in the DALs of the project. Xavier and Darius assisted in that aspect where they were bug fixing the foreign key constraints. Another issue we encountered was 
            how the file uploading not working as orignally intended. This could be due to our lack of experience in Firebase and how it stores files.

            On week 5 of Assignment 1, we were to participate in the BYTE® Hackz 2021 Hackathon which began on 17/11/2021 9am, and ended on 19/11/2021 around 12.30pm. The first 2 days of the 
            Hackathon were dedicated to bug fixing, implementating last minute features etc. There were also team building games such as nerf and tic tac toe. At this point in time, I was extremely
            stressed due to the worry of not being able to accomplish what the team and I had set out to do on time. Features such as oneToken and oneLink were still quite buggy 
            though they were semi-functional. I was also worried that my UI/UX skills were not sufficient to meet OCBC Bank's high standards and this was coupled with the fact that 
            I was in charge of all the Front End Development of oneJoint.
            <br>
            Due to this anxiety, I started work early in Week 5 on Monday to attempt to fix as many bugs as I could and complete the remaining views before the Hackathon on Wednesday. 
            When Wednesday finally arrived, I felt a sense of despair due to the fact that I had not finished all of oneJoint's views and its back end code. Thankfully, Jun Hong and Xavier 
            assisted me with the back end code while I completed the remaining views as seen in Figure 5.1 and 5.2 (Above) while we discussed other problems with the oneJoint prototype. Furthermore, we came together as team when we 
            strived to win the nerf challenge organized by Overflow SIG during the hackathon. With the help of my teammates and the organized activities, I felt more at ease.

            Day 2 of the Hackathon began and the whole team was struggling to fix the multiple bugs that oneJoint still had. In hindsight, this could have been avoided if we had adopted 
            Test Driven Development(TDD) but unfortunately we were only aware of it a few weeks after the Hackathon. Relating to our lack of knowledge for TDD, I felt that our skills in Agile 
            Methodology were lacking largely due to the fact that by Week 5, for our respective SDD classes, we had only come up with an inception deck and have not actually practised the software 
            development methodlogy in a real project as of yet. Throughout these 2 days, Jun Hong surprised me with the amount of effort/time he was willing to put in to deliver a good prototype/presentation 
            to OCBC Bank. Not only was he responsible for oneJoint's 2FA methods but also assisted me in back end code and database as well. 
            <br>
            However, our team had not completed our presentation slides. The planned video showcasing a typical joint application was not recorded and numerous slides 
            were still incomplete. After going through our rough script with Mr Joel Yang late in the Afternoon on Day 2 of the Hackathon, I rushed home to edit the recorded demo as previously mentioned which 
            was recorded by Jun Hong on the last day. Being inexperienced with Adobe Premiere Pro and professional editing software, I turned to iMovie on my iPhone and succesfully edited and compiled 
            the recording in around 2 hours. My anxiety had returned and I believed all my teammates and I were extremely fatigued from the long day but still determined to put out a good presentation tomorrow. 
            As a result, Jun Hong, Darius and I stayed up to 2am that night to rehearse and polish our presentation prior to OCBC Bank reviewing it for themselves. 
            During the day of presentation, I felt confident in oneJoint and my team and I managed to deliver the presentation as planned. However, I still believed we could have done much better.

            Even as I write this blog today, I can stil recall the numerous hours I had put into oneJoint. Despite this, I believe several aspects of how I handled 
            my team and oneJoint could have been much better. For example, I usually was the one to initiate group discussions early on in the Assignment which led to many of my ideas being 
            implemented and as a result, my teammates did not have as much of a influence in oneJoint. I should have pushed for my teammates to offer their ideas as I definitely would not have 
            the best solutions to all the problems we would encounter during these 5 weeks. Secondly, during the presentation, one of the OCBC judges suggested that we should have had 
            a SMS one time password system alongside our existing oneLink and oneToken authentication methods. This was one of our cut features due to a lack of time management and we intend 
            to correct this flaw in Assignemnt 2 in January. I came into PFD confident to experience proper software development to deliver a product of high quality. Although I believe that 
            we had put out a decent product, it was not the one I had expected at the start of this module. However, I did pick up many leadership skills and now have a greater understanding of how 
            to prioritize and delegate tasks to others. Going forward, it is unlikely I will ever forget oneJoint due to the stress, anxiety it caused and yet I look forward to improving it in Assignment 2!
