          <p class="index-paragraph">
            When I first looked at the challenge statement, <b>"Safe and Seamless Joint Account Creation"</b>, I was rather <b>intimidated</b> as I had only worked on 
            account creations for a single person and never two. On top of this, it being safe and seamless was important as the prototype was being designed
            for <b>OCBC Bank</b>. This means that in theory, security is essential as we would be dealing with OCBC's customers' funds and personal details such as NRIC and more.
            These requirements made me nervous yet excited to test my skills at something I have never done.
            <br>
            In the first lesson of PFD, our lecturer, <b>Mr Joel Yang</b>, instructed us to fill in our strengths and weakness in terms of technical aspects
            such as <b>programming knowledge</b>, <b>UI/UX design</b> and more. Later on, we were told to use padlet and fill in our ideas for a prototype which solves
            the provide challenge statement and then vote for other suggestions. To my surprise, I was chosen as a <b>Group Leader</b> after receiving the 4th most votes
            as seen in the image on the left. Following this, I had to select my group members anonymously according to their strengths and weaknesses. I tried my best to
            pick members of different strengths that cover each other's weaknesses as well as my own. 
            Week 1's lesson made me feel rather <b>uneasy</b> as I have never worked with my group members before and was worried that I would not be able to lead
            a team effectively.

            Since the chosen challenge statement only involved IT students, I was sure that majority of the team had the necessary technical skills to develop
            a working prototype for Joint Account Creation. This was due to us undergoing a module called "Web Application Development" in Semester 2.1 which allowed
            us to develop our full-stack development skills which we had gathered from prior modules such as "Databases" and "Interactive Development". Out of the 5 of us 
            in the team, only 2 members were experienced in Mobile App Development. As a result, we decided on developing a web application using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework
            and an SQL database. Being the team leader, I set up a Trello Board for us to collaborate and quickly assigned a tasks for each member to complete by an agreed deadline.
            I also began to work on oneJoint's wireframe at this time on Adobe XD. Since the rest of the team were not adept in UI/UX Design, I took charge of most if not 
            all of the Front End Development.

            Once I had settled in with my new group members, Week 2's Lesson had begun. Mr Joel Yang went on to brief us on group/conflict management 
            and that there were many different conflict management styles. As seen from Figure 2.1 (Above), there were 5 styles consisting of a <b>shark,
            turtle, fox, teddy-bear and owl</b> which all have their own characteristics. After completing some questions, my team and I were able to determine 
            which animal we were able to relate to the most. I was quite well rounded excluding the turtle with <b>Collaborating</b> and <b>Accommodating</b> being my 
            highest triats at 9 which means I am most like a <b>teddy-bear</b> and an <b>owl</b>. The rest of my team also had similar traits as seen in 
            Figure 2.2 (Above) which made me believe we would be able to work together well to deliver a good prototype for OCBC bank.

            <br>
            My team and I were currently in the storming/norming stages of team development where some are afraid to show their opinion and there could be some <b>clashes</b>
            in opinion on how to proceed. Thankfully, we were respectful towards one another and managed to agree on certain issues early on so they do not persist and 
            drag down our productivity later on.

            As discussed in Week 1, I was in charge of the overall <b>UI/UX</b> of oneJoint and I had created a wireframe as seen in Figure 2.3 (Left). <b>Jun Hong</b>,
            one of my team members also has created a data dictionary while <b>Xavier</b> had been hard at work creating a SQL data script based off the data dictionary.
            The other 2 members, <b>Darius</b> and <b>Tze Siong</b> were researching on how Joint Accounts were created in existing systems and what information is required so as to
            improve the data dictionary.
            At this point in Assignment 1, I had created a base ASP.NET MVC Core project using Visual Studio Community 2019 along with portions of the landing page 
            being completed. We were past the <b>storming</b> stage and were able to convery our ideas and opinions effectively.

          <div class="index-paragraph" style="padding-bottom:25px;">
            In Week 3, the team and I have completed oneJoint's landing page as seen in Figure 3.1 (Right) and have tested a few 2 factor authentication(2FA)
            methods to ensure the security of our Joint Account system. These include <b>oneToken</b>, our mobile app authentication method and <b>oneLink</b>, our email 
            authentication method as seen in Figure 3.2 (Below). Jun Hong was in charge of oneToken and created the mobile app for it as well as relevant Firebase libraries and code. Xavier
            had completed the database script and was modifying it as we discovered more business requirements and bugs with our orignal code. Meanwhile, Tze
            Siong and Darius worked on polishing our <b>Inception Deck</b> and completing <b>Data Access Layers(DALs)</b> of oneJoint.

            <br>
            Other than Front End Development, I was also responsible for the <b>main flow</b> of the Joint Account application. At first, it was difficult to determine
            which authentication system to use for what kind of user(E.g. Singaporean/PR, Foreigner etc). However, as I discused with the rest of the team, we had simplified
            the process to those who were not existing customers to use oneLink and those who were existing customer utilize oneToken due to their existing OCBC accounts which are 
            required to login into our mobile app. Our meetings with our OCBC instructor, Yan Jie were also quite <b>constructive</b> as he had many meaningful insights into 
            what is expected of us and how we should go about achieving it. For example in Week 3, he commented that we had focused too much on business requirements when 
            OCBC Bank was not expecting us to produce a highly accurate Joint Account system.

            At this stage of Assignment 1, my team 1 and I were close to the "Performing" stage of team development. This was accommodated by a F2F session with 
            Mr Joel Yang on Wednesday(10/11/2021) which was much more productive compared to the Teams meetings we had been having up to this point. We were able to 
            communicate our opinions more effectively. Furthermore, Mr Joel Yang provided critical feedback/criticism on our current progress and state of affairs. He also
            gave us some recommendations on how to improve/market oneJoint for the presentation with OCBC Bank in Week 5.

            <br>

            oneJoint had its main and joint applicant forms completely in terms of the Front End but the Back End which includes C# and SQL database still had some teething
            issues to be fixed. For example, there was an issue
