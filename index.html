        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 index-paragraph">
          When I first looked at the challenge statement,
          <b>"Safe and Seamless Joint Account Creation"</b>, I was rather
          <b>intimidated</b> as I had only worked on account creations for a
          single person and never two. On top of this, it being safe and
          seamless was important as the prototype was being designed for
          <b>OCBC Bank</b>. This means that in theory, security is essential as
          we would be dealing with OCBC's customers' funds and personal details
          such as NRIC and more. These requirements made me nervous yet excited
          to test my skills at something I have never done.
          <br />
          In the first lesson of PFD, our lecturer, <b>Mr Joel Yang</b>,
          instructed us to fill in our strengths and weakness in terms of
          technical aspects such as <b>programming knowledge</b>,
          <b>UI/UX design</b> and more. Later on, we were told to use padlet and
          fill in our ideas for a prototype which solves the provide challenge
          statement and then vote for other suggestions. To my surprise, I was
          chosen as a <b>Group Leader</b> after receiving the 4th most votes as
          seen in the image on the left. Following this, I had to select my
          group members anonymously according to their strengths and weaknesses.
          I tried my best to pick members of different strengths that cover each
          other's weaknesses as well as my own. Week 1's lesson made me feel
          rather <b>uneasy</b> as I have never worked with my group members
          before and was worried that I would not be able to lead a team
          effectively.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 index-paragraph">
          Since the chosen challenge statement only involved IT students, I was
          sure that majority of the team had the <b>necessary</b> technical
          skills to develop a working prototype for Joint Account Creation. This
          was due to us undergoing a module called
          <b>"Web Application Development"</b> in Semester 2.1 which allowed us
          to develop our full-stack development skills which we had gathered
          from prior modules such as <b>"Databases"</b> and
          <b>"Interactive Development"</b>. Out of the 5 of us in the team, only
          2 members were experienced in Mobile App Development. As a result, we
          decided on developing a web application using the
          <b>ASP.NET Core MVC framework</b> and <b>SQL</b> database. Being the
          team leader, I set up a Trello Board for us to collaborate and quickly
          assigned a tasks for each member to complete by an agreed deadline. I
          also began to work on <b>oneJoint's</b> wireframe at this time on
          Adobe XD. Since the rest of the team were not adept in UI/UX Design, I
          took charge of most if not all of the Front End Development.

          Once I had settled in with my new group members, Week 2's Lesson had
          begun. Mr Joel Yang went on to brief us on group/conflict management
          and that there were many different conflict management styles. As seen
          from Figure 2.1 (Above), there were 5 styles consisting of a
          <b>shark, turtle, fox, teddy-bear and owl</b> which all have their own
          characteristics. After completing some questions, my team and I were
          able to determine which animal we were able to relate to the most. I
          was quite well rounded excluding the turtle with
          <b>Collaborating</b> and <b>Accommodating</b> being my highest triats
          at 9 which means I am most like a <b>teddy-bear</b> and an <b>owl</b>.
          The rest of my team also had similar traits as seen in Figure 2.2
          (Above) which made me believe we would be able to work together well
          to deliver a good prototype for OCBC bank.

          <br />
          My team and I were currently in the storming/norming stages of team
          development where some are afraid to show their opinion and there
          could be some <b>clashes</b>
          in opinion on how to proceed. Thankfully, we were respectful towards
          one another and managed to agree on certain issues early on so they do
          not persist and drag down our productivity later on.

            As discussed in Week 1, I was in charge of the overall

            The other 2 members, <b>Darius</b> and <b>Tze Siong</b> were

            and what information is required so as to improve the data

            ASP.NET MVC Core project using Visual Studio Community 2019 along
            with portions of the landing page being completed. We were past the
            <b>storming</b> stage and were able to convery our ideas and

      <div class="row">
        <h1 class="week-header">Week 3</h1>
        <div class="col-lg-6 index-paragraph">
          In Week 3, the team and I have completed <b>oneJoint's</b> landing
          page as seen in Figure 3.1 (Right) and have tested a few 2 factor
          authentication(2FA) methods to ensure the security of our Joint
          Account system. These include <b>oneToken</b>, our mobile app
          authentication method and <b>oneLink</b>, our email authentication
          method as seen in Figure 3.2 (Below). Jun Hong was in charge of
          oneToken and created the mobile app for it as well as relevant
          Firebase libraries and code. Xavier had completed the database script
          and was modifying it as we discovered more business requirements and
          bugs with our orignal code. Meanwhile, Tze Siong and Darius worked on
          polishing our <b>Inception Deck</b> and completing
          <b>Data Access Layers(DALs)</b> of <b>oneJoint</b>.

          <br />
          Other than Front End Development, I was also responsible for the
          <b>main flow</b> of the Joint Account application. At first, it was
          difficult to determine which authentication system to use for what
          kind of user(E.g. Singaporean/PR, Foreigner etc). However, as I
          discused with the rest of the team, we had simplified the process to
          those who were not existing customers to use oneLink and those who
          were existing customer utilize oneToken due to their existing OCBC
          accounts which are required to login into our mobile app. Our meetings
          with our OCBC instructor, Yan Jie were also quite
          <b>constructive</b> as he had many meaningful insights into what is
          expected of us and how we should go about achieving it. For example in
          Week 3, he commented that we had focused too much on business
          requirements when OCBC Bank was not expecting us to produce a highly
          accurate Joint Account system.

          At this stage of Assignment 1, my team 1 and I were close to the
          <b>"Performing"</b> stage of team development. This was accommodated
          by a <b>F2F</b> session with Mr Joel Yang on Wednesday(10/11/2021)
          which was much more <b>productive</b> compared to the Teams meetings
          we had been having up to this point. We were able to communicate our
          opinions more <b>effectively</b> and were more focused as the deadline
          of Assignment 1 drew closer. Furthermore, Mr Joel Yang provided
          <b>critical feedback/criticism </b> on our current progress and state
          of affairs. He also gave us some recommendations on how to
          improve/market <b>oneJoint</b> for the presentation with OCBC Bank in
          Week 5. For example, Mr Joel recommended that we add a timeline of
          sorts to display to the user which step of the application he/she was
          at. As a result, I implemented a simplistic timeline as seen in Figure
          4.1 (Left).

          <br />

          <b>oneJoint</b> had its main and joint applicant forms completely in
          terms of the Front End but the Back End which includes C# and SQL
          database still had some <b>teething issues</b> to be fixed. For
          example, there were many <b>foreign key constraint</b> issues with SQL
          database as seen in Figure 4.2 (Above) when we first completed the
          code for the back end of the applicant forms. However, due to MVC and
          its <b>separation of concerns</b>, we were able to diagnose the
          problems quickly and assessed that the problem in the DALs of the
          project. Xavier and Darius assisted in that aspect where they were bug
          fixing the foreign key constraints. Another issue we encountered was
          how the file uploading not working as orignally intended. This could
          be due to our <b>lack of experience</b> in Firebase and how it stores
          files.

          On week 5 of Assignment 1, we were to participate in the

          Due to this <b>anxiety</b>, I started work early in Week 5 on Monday
          to attempt to fix as many bugs as I could and complete the remaining
          views before the Hackathon on Wednesday. When Wednesday finally
          arrived, I felt a sense of despair due to the fact that I had
          <b>not</b> finished all of <b>oneJoint's</b> views and its back end
          code. Thankfully, <b>Jun Hong</b> and <b>Xavier</b> assisted me with
          the back end code while I completed the remaining views as seen in
          Figure 5.1 and 5.2 (Above) while we discussed other problems with the
          oneJoint prototype. Furthermore, we came together as team when we
          strived to win the nerf challenge organized by Overflow SIG during the
          hackathon. With the help of my teammates and the organized activities,
          I felt more <b>at ease</b>.

          Day 2 of the Hackathon began and the whole team was struggling to fix
          the multiple bugs that <b>oneJoint</b> still had. In hindsight, this
          could have been avoided if we had adopted
          <b>Test Driven Development(TDD)</b> but unfortunately we were only
          aware of it a few weeks <b>after</b> the Hackathon. Relating to our
          lack of knowledge for TDD, I felt that our skills in Agile Methodology
          were largely <b>lacking</b> due to the fact that by Week 5, for our
          respective SDD classes, we had only come up with an inception deck and
          have not actually practised the software development methodlogy in a
          real project as of yet. Throughout these 2 days,
          <b>Jun Hong</b> surprised me with the amount of effort/time he was
          willing to put in to deliver a good prototype/presentation to OCBC
          Bank. Not only was he responsible for <b>oneJoint's</b> 2FA methods
          but also assisted me in back end code and database as well.
          <br />
          However, our team had <b>yet to complete</b> our presentation slides.
          The planned video showcasing a typical joint application was
          <b>not</b> recorded and numerous slides were still incomplete. After
          going through our rough script with Mr Joel Yang late in the afternoon
          on Day 2 of the Hackathon, I rushed home to edit the recorded demo as
          previously mentioned which was recorded by Jun Hong on the last day.
          Being <b>inexperienced</b> with Adobe Premiere Pro and professional
          editing software, I turned to <b>iMovie</b> on my iPhone and
          succesfully edited and compiled the recording in around 2 hours. My
          anxiety had returned and I believed all my teammates and I were
          extremely fatigued from the long day but still determined to put out a
          good presentation tomorrow. As a result, Jun Hong, Darius and I stayed
          up to <b>2am</b> that night to rehearse and polish our presentation
          prior to the presentation with OCBC Bank tomorrow. On the day of
          presentation, I felt confident in <b>oneJoint</b> and my team due to
          the prior preparation we had done. As a result, we managed to deliver
          the presentation as planned. <b>However</b>, I still believed we could
          have done much better.

          Post Assignment 1 Reflection
        </h1>
        <div class="col-lg-9 index-paragraph">
          Even as I write this blog today, I can stil recall the numerous hours
          I had put into <b>oneJoint</b>. Despite this, I believe several
          aspects of how I handled my team and <b>oneJoint</b> could have been
          <b>much better</b>. For example, I usually was the one to
          <b>initiate</b> group discussions early on in the Assignment which led
          to many of my ideas being implemented and as a result, my teammates
          <b>did not</b> have as much of a influence in <b>oneJoint</b>. I
          should have pushed for my teammates to offer their ideas as I
          definitely would not have the best solutions to all the problems we
          would encounter during these 5 weeks. Secondly, during the
          presentation, one of the OCBC judges suggested that we should have had
          an <b>SMS one time password system</b> for elderlies alongside our
          existing oneLink and oneToken authentication methods. This was one of
          our <b>cut</b> features due to a lack of <b>time management</b> and I
          intend to correct this flaw in Assignemnt 2 in January. Overall, I
          came into PFD <b>confident</b> to experience proper software
          development to deliver a product of high quality. Although I believe
          that we had put out a <b>decent</b> product, it was
          <b>not the one</b> I had expected at the start of this module.
          However, I did pick up many <b>leadership</b> skills and now have a
          <b>greater understanding</b> of how to prioritize and delegate tasks
          to others. Going forward, it is unlikely I will ever forget
          <b>oneJoint</b> due to the <b>stress, anxiety</b> it caused and yet I
          look forward to improving it in Assignment 2!

          In Week 12, Team Meta and I discussed what went <b>well</b> and what went <b>wrong</b> in Assignment 1 similar to a <b>Sprint Retropsective</b>. We concluded that 
          the end product was decent, however, the route that we took to get there had <b>room for improvement</b>. We realized that more <b>consistent work</b> throughout 
          the Assignment was beneficial as we had spent too much time bug-fixing at the last minute in Assignment 1. We discussed some pain points of oneJoint in Assignment 1 
          and arrived at a few conclusions. </br>

          Furthermore, we came up with the <b>initial
          improvements</b> as seen below for Assignment 2 which included a <b>mobile app</b> built from the ground up using Java but still retained the same database to ensure 
          seamless <b>integration</b> with oneJoint's web application. The following improvements were curated to also alleviate the previously mentioned pain points.

          Following <b>Week 12</b> where we had decided on the improvements Team Meta wished to achieve in Assignment 2, I begun work on the <b>UI/UX design</b> for <b>oneJoint mobile</b>
          on <b>Adobe XD</b>. I did not take up Mobile Applications Development 1 or 2 as an elective and hence I was intiailly worried that my wireframes may <b>not be suitable </b>
          for the mobile app developers in Team Meta to develop. These mobile app developers consisted of <b>Jun Hong, Xavier and Darius</b>. As a result, I made sure with Jun Hong 
          that my wireframes were suitable and achievable in the given time span. This required <b>constant communication</b> throughout Assignment 2. 
          Following the UI/UX design for oneJoint Mobile, Jun Hong and I worked on <b>hosting</b> oneJoint's web application 
          databases on <b>Micosoft Azure</b>. After setting up a student account, I had succesfully hosted the <b>databases</b> and the <b>web application</b> with some help from my tutor, <b>Mr Joel Yang</b>. He 
          assisted us by troubleshooting some networking issues and some advice on the pricing of Microsoft Azure. <br>
          At the end of Week 13, Jun Hong and the rest of the mobile app development team had begun work on oneJoint mobile. I felt quite <b>satisfied</b> with Team Meta's pacing 
          and felt <b>confident yet cautious</b> that we could deliver a new and improved oneJoint on time.

            Weeks <b>14 and 15</b> were when most of oneJoint's improvements <b>came together</b>. I had worked out how to implement <b>dark mode</b> on the oneJoint web as seen in <b>Figure 7.1</b> (Above) 
            while Jun Hong and the rest of the mobile app development team had made <b>steady</b> progress as well. Furthermore, <b>Darius</b> had implemented the <b>IP address tracking </b>
            succesfully as seen in <b>Figure 7.2</b> (Above) and testing for these relevant features were also progressing well. Furthermore, <b>Tze Siong</b> and <b>I</b> completed the <b>forget password</b> feature as well as seen in <b>Figure 7.3</b> (Below)  <br>
            <b>Darius</b> and <b>Xavier</b> also delivered on the <b>encrypted password</b> feature as seen in Figure 7.4 (Below). This particular feature took <b>extensive testing</b> as during development, 
            hashing the passwords caused a <b>multitude</b> of problems. Since the password of a accountholder in oneJoint is used in various parts the web application, portions such as 
            the joint application form and login had <b>many bugs</b> that required fixing. Firebase also added another layer of complexity due to its <b>restrictive</b> nature and not allowing developers
            to access the stored passwords directly. Going forward, I would like to leave Firebase behind for at least considerable sized projects. Firebase is a good starting platform but 
            the limitations we experienced throughout Assignment 2 could have largely been <b>avoided</b> if we had opted for <b>Microsoft Azure</b> to store all our authentication and user data, instead of using 2 different databases.

          To conclude this <b>physically</b> and <b>mentally</b> exhausting 16 weeks of Portfolio Development(PFD), I found the entire experience very <b>enlightening</b>. I gained
          <b>leadership</b> skills by being group leader of Team Meta yet I also gained <b>numerous new friends</b> at Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of ICT, some of which I will 
          continue to meet regularly during my 1 Year Internship with OCBC Bank. PFD did not provide us any materials aside from the intial group management and I actually 
          <b>took a liking</b> to it. It enabled me to take the <b>intiative</b> and not wait for someone else to advise me on how to proceed. I learnt numerous <b>new technical skills</b> such as hosting, hasing etc.
          throughout Assignments 1 and 2. However, this was only made possible by my <b>team members</b>. I have heard of instances where other students are not able to pick 
          up new hard skills due to group members not pulling their weight which sours the overall experience. I am very <b>appreciative</b> that <b>Jun Hong, Xavier, Darius and Tze Siong</b> are responsible individuals and 
          try their best to put out quality work. Finally, <b>Mr Joel Yang</b> as a lecturer is rather <b>interesting</b> due to his <b>unique personality</b> and <b>unusual</b> method of teaching.
          Could it be due to him being a <b>former</b> Ngee Ann Polytechnic IT student himself? I may never know.
