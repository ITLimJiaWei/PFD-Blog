                    Week 1 of Semester 4 was as expected. It was filled with module briefings and unsurprisingly almost all my classes
                    were Home-Based. After completing all my practicals for the Week, I was planning on how I was going to approach
                    my chosen challenge statment which is creating a system where OCBC customers can create joint accounts online.
                    However, to my surprise I was assigned to be a team leader after filling in a padlet and a mini resume

                    After adding my group members to a telegram chat, lesson 2 began. 
                    During our first meeting, we came up with some questions to ask the OCBC representative, Yan Jie and researched what types of data would
                    be required for our problem statement. We also considered non residents who do not have a SingPass account so the 
                    process would be more accommodating. After creating an XD file and google docs we concluded the meeting. In my opinion,
                    it was quite productive and my group seems pleasant to work with. I look forward to more group meetings in the future.
