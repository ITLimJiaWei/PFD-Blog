                    Our lecturer, Joel Yang taught us about Conflict Management in groups and how
                    different people have different ways of managing it be it confrontational or avoiding
                    the problem. In my opinion, it is good to be confrontational but one should refrain 
                    from being hostile and be confrontational only to tackle the issue instead of insulting
                    other team members. I learnt that most of my team and I have similar ways of managing conflict 
                    and look forward to us working together.

                    Team 1 and I consulted Yan Jie, the OCBC representative and we received crucial
                    information on what OCBC wished the prototype to be. We were told not to focus
                    too much on the business domain and rather focus on the IT implementation first. 
                    He also reminded us on the security aspects of a banking application. So far, I feel that 
                    Team 1 and I have made good progress on a wireframe and data dictionary. However, the real 
                    software developemnt begins now and we have a long way to go to a final prototype.
