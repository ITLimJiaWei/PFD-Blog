                    There was no PFD lesson 1 this week as other groups were meeting with Mr Joel, our lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic campus
                    and we were left on our own to work on the project. By this time, we had finished creating the SQL database and have tested that 
                    our OTP system works. I have finished all the models for the Joint Account database and I believe we are making good progress.

                    For Lesson 2 we consulted Yan Jie again and he gave us constructive feedback esepcially on the customer experience side of things.
                    He remidned us that the Joint Applicant should be able to easily check the application information in case the main applicant 
                    enter his/her information wrongly. Yan Jie was a great help and my team and I are moving onto the main portion of the project 
                    where we develop the Views in ASP.NET MVC for the Join Account creation.
